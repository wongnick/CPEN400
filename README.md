These files contain individual web assignments consisting of Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 
Each assignment adds another level of functionality from its previous. You can easily 
view and play around with the web pages by opening the index.js files via Chrome or 
Firefox. Assignment #5 however requires the use of MongoDB and Node.js. Enjoy!
